  <h2 id="p1"><b>Introduction</b></h2>


  <p>
  This essay will explore the concept of design thinking and how Pentagram
    partner and designer, Natasha Jen has an issue with it. I will begin by
    exploring who Natasha Jen is, her education and work. It will also examine
    what “Design Thinking” actually is and what issues Jen has raised
    surrounding the concept of “Design Thinking”. The main focus of this essay
    however,  will be understanding why Jen has raised these issues with the
    concept of “Design Thinking” and what she proposes as a solution.
</p>




  <h2 id="p3"><b>Who is Natasha Jen?</b></h2>


  <p>Jen was born in Taipei , Taiwan in 1976 where she lived for 20 years until
    she moved to New York city to study fine art at the School of Visual Arts in
    1996. After some time , Jen realised that fine art wasn’t what she wanted
    to pursue and began to look into different options. Eventually Jen chose to
    study Graphic Design at the School of Visual Arts  where she completed her
    studies and received her BFA with Honours in 2002. <img id="I1" src="images/buffy.jpg"
    alt="Natasha Jen's work"/>
During her studies Jen
    interned with a studio called Eric Baker Design and also with Pentagram
    where she is currently a partner since 2012.</p>



  <p>Jen’s first full time job after finishing her studies was at Sony Music
    where she designed covers for CD’s , although this work did not satisfy her
    so she only stayed for 6 months before leaving to work for Base design as a
    Senior designer on fashion and brand identity. Jen then went on to work for
    2 x 4 Inc. as an art director where she lead large scale branding ,
    environmental , editorial and exhibition projects.<img id="I3" src="images/buffy2.jpg"
    alt="Natasha Jens work"/> Jen also worked at Stone
    Yamashita Partners as a creative director before going on to open her own
    studio , Njenworks in July 2010. Eventually in 2012 , Jen joined Pentagrams
    New York office as partner in April 2012. </p>

    <h2 id="p2"><b>What actually is Design Thinking?</b></h2>

    <img id="I2" src="images/designthinking.png"
    alt="Design thinking diagram"/>
  <p>Design thinking is defined as a process which is applicable to all walks of
     life , of creating new and innovative ideas and solving problems. Design
     thinking is not limited to a specific industry. Design thinking is broken
     down into five core steps , these steps are used to solve any problem ,
     empathise , define , test , ideate and prototype. interaction-design.org
     mention that “Design thinking provides a solution-based approach to solving
     problems. It is a way of thinking and working as well as a collection of
     hands-on methods.” Christina Wodtke is a designer who when she first heard
     about Design Thinking , she didn’t think it was anything special , but
     over time she felt that design thinking , for her , works better than
     other approaches to product and service innovation.</p>






  <h2 id="p4"><b>What is the problem and why?</b></h2>

  <p>Jen notably has an issue with the concept of “design thinking”.  Jen
    explains that the problem starts with “design thinking’ being an intangible
    thing that is impossible to describe.  Jen states “I just can’t wrap my head
    around design thinking , and I ask myself why can’t I understand it? The
    more I get into it , the more outrageous it appears”. ( “why design
    thinking is bullshit” itsnicethat.com) The first issue Jen raised with the
    concept of “design thinking” is its simplicity. How can this “one size fits
    all”  approach be applied to everything? Jen argues that if we follow this
    five step process, there is a crucial step missing that should be used in
    between prototyping and testing. Jen believes that this new step should
    involve sitting down with a group of people where everyone will analyse
    and critique a piece of work so that it can be improved upon before it
    is released to the public.  </p>

    <img id="I4" src="images/njposter.jpg"
    alt="a poster on design thinking by natasha jen"/>
  <p>In her talk titled “Design thinking is Bullsh*t” for Adobe 99U, Jen
    described design criticism as “ You bring forth an idea. You bring forth
    evidence and then everybody crit’s the heck out of it. And that’s when you
    can make improvements, right?” (Adobe 99U)Jen believes that in order for us
    as designers to improve upon our work we must receive criticism and take
    into consideration what others are saying or thinking about our work and
    then apply these thoughts to our own ideas. I agree with Jen’s beliefs
    surrounding design criticism as I have used this idea in my own work and it
    has helped me improve upon a design by taking into account what those who
    were looking at my work were saying. </p>


  <p>In the same talk, Jen also explained what she defines design thinking as,
    how she feels that design thinking “packages the designers way by working
    for a non - designer audience, by codifying their processes into perspective
    , step by step approach to creative solving.” (Adobe 99U) In other words,
    design thinking restricts a designers creative approach to a step by step
    structured process which must be followed in order for it to be considered
    “design thinking”. It therefore doesn’t allow designers the same amount of
    creative freedom they would normally have if they were not following design
    thinkings step by step process. Jen has expressed that she has another
    problem with design thinking, and this time it isn’t design thinking as a
    theory, its the fact that she had not heard “a voice or much voice from the
    design community to actually try to reshape this conversation”. (Adobe 99U)
    Jen is one of the only designers in the industry to express her views on
    design thinking , although there are some other designers who agree with her
    and share the same opinion.</p>

    <h2 id="p5"><b>Designers Who both agree and disagree with Jen’s ideas</b></h2>

    <p>Lee Vinsel is another designer who believes that the Design Thinking
      movement is absurd. He has expressed on medium.com that he agrees with
      Jen’s views surrounding design thinking. Vinsel explains how he feels as
      if design thinking is an idea which is too vague , and the further you
      delve into the idea of design thinking , the vaguer the entire theory
      becomes. I agree with Vinsel as I find Design Thinking very difficult to
      understand , I don’t understand how it can be applied effectively to
      different concepts and produce a positive end result. Surely Design
      Thinking cannot be successful in every circumstance.</p>

    <p>Hannah Kim also expressed her view on design thinking on medium.com.
       Kim explains that after she watched Jen’s “Design thinking is Bullshit”
       talk with Adobe 99U she could understand why Jen had these views on
       Design Thinking. Kim stated that she thinks the reason that designers
       like herself and Jen have a hard time accepting design thinking , is
       because they think about design in a traditional sense , where
       sketching and photoshop are seen as their tools, not post it notes,
       which are commonly used when design thinking is being put into
       practice. Although Kim agree’s with some of Jen’s ideas , she disagrees
       with Jen’s argument that Criticism is missing from the design thinking
       process , Kim believes that the criticism can happen in the
       prototyping and testing phase. For me , I can see where Kim is coming
       from with this idea , but I feel that it is not made clear enough
       for those following the Design Thinking theory that criticism can
       take place during the prototyping and testing phase.</p>

       <h2 id="p6"><b>Conclusion</b></h2>

    <p>In conclusion Natasha Jen believes that design thinking is an intangible
      thing which is impossible to describe , and if we cannot describe an
      ideology which is meant to help us , how can we utilise it in a way which
      will result in a positive outcome? Jen believes design thinking is too
      vague and other designers have agreed with her on this criticism such as
      Vinsel. Jen also believes it is impossible to use a one size fits all
      approach when it comes to designing , therefore rendering the idea of
      design thinking useless as it suggests a one size fits all approach. A
      Critique session is also missing in the process of design thinking , which
      Jen see’s as a huge disadvantage as in order for a design to be successful
      it needs to be critiqued in order for the designer to improve their work
      and perfect it. All of these factors contribute to Jen’s issue with design
      thinking.</p>
